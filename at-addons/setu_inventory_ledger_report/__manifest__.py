        Inventory Ledger Report
        It’s necessary to know inventory movements each day with all possible movements for each product for each warehouse or company and it’s very difficult to manage.
        So we introduced a solution for that and built an Inventory Ledger Report where users can track each day's transactions or summary of all dates together with real calculated opening and closing. 
        This app helps you to track the inventory for specific periods or up to a certain date.
